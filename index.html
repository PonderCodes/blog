        Hi. I'm Ponder. Of course, that's a pseudonym. I write code. I've been in the software industry for
        Quite Some Time. I like writing software, building automated systems. I suppose I'll be using this as
        a creative outlet. Or ... more like documenting my creative outlet project.

        The project: code your own AI to play your character in a game. Write it in Dart, target
        the web, make it a PWA, implement native-ish features like payments and passes. That's the high-
        level. Details to come in other posts.

        That's it for the introduction. I usually like to be fairly succint.
