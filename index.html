      Hi. I'm Ponder. Of course, that's a pseudonym. I write code. I've been in the software industry for
      Quite Some Time. I like writing software, building automated systems. I suppose I'll be using this as
      a creative outlet. Or ... more like documenting my creative outlet project.
      The project: code your own AI to play your character in a game. Write it in Dart, target
      the web, make it a PWA, implement native-ish features like payments and passes. That's the high-
      level. Details to come in other posts.

        Let's get started on it. First, we need some amount of planning. We'll start with a game of
        snake. I believe an ECS (Entity Component System, sometimes Entity System) will serve this game well.
        Entities will include snake heads, snake bodies, food. Those will need components like location,
        color, direction, a counter. We probably also want entities for our rendering canvas and some other
        things. We also need systems for rendering, scoring, generating food, and command input (some way to
        tell the snakes which direction to go.)
